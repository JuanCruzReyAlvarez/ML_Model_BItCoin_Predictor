# ML_Model_BItCoin_Predictor
Configure a controller that uses different sources of information, parsing different news about bitcoin wich controller considers important. Based on these parsed news, data engineering was applied to fit the information in the best way, obtaining the best performance in our model. We develop more than one model until we get a considerably good accuracy, ROC, AUC, etc. We train the model with three datasets that provide us with huge information  For each Data set i jave the value of the sentiment associated with each sentence. This is precisely our target and we express it in 0 or 1. Positive or Negative To finish ensuring that the model works correctly, I develop a database to save the date and the result of the model, so is possible to compared with the value of the real bitcoin evolution and check if the model's prediction was correct.
